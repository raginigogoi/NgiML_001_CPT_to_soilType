    "Permutation Feature Importance (PFI) is a model-agnostic method to evaluate the importance of features in a machine learning model. The idea is to shuffle the values of a feature and measure the impact on the model's performance. If the performance decreases significantly, it means that the feature is important for the model.\n",
